That\\'s a deck of cards hitting a bottle of soy sauce.<br/> Eric, please come home.<br/> You have no idea how much I miss you.<br/> I miss you too, honey.<br/> I don\\'t think I\\'ll be happy until I see you again.<br/> Hey.<br/> Steven\\'s home! Okay Miss Kitty, he doesn\\'t like to be hugged! Don\\'t you ever leave me again! I spilled my soda Hiii\\'yde\\'.<br/> I don\\'t know what to say, man.<br/> What about \"Ow\"? Why would I say \\'ow\\'? Ah, I get it! Eric, Steven just hit Michael.<br/> And while I\\'m very disappointed in Steven for hitting Michael.<br/> It was very exciting! Come on man, get up.<br/> Why? So you can deck me again? No.<br/> Actually I\\'m fine now.<br/> Everything I wanted to say was in that one punch.<br/> Come on.<br/> It was a good one too.<br/> Peed myself a little on the way down.<br/> I\\'m gonna go change.<br/> Hyde, where have you been? I\\'ve been hanging out in Las Vegas, my man.<br/> And I\\'ve learned this: you don\\'t wanna show up late to a Don Rickles Show with puffy hair.<br/> Well, you could have let us know where you were.<br/> I was worried sick about you and I am very I got you this.<br/> A little tiny slotmachine! It is so cute.<br/> Steven, you\\'re back! Look, we have to talk.<br/> About what? How you nailed Kelso? No, about our relationship.<br/> Oh, okay.<br/> I\\'ll start You nailed Kelso! You never gave me a chance to explain! Because you nailed Kelso! Mrs.<br/> Forman, start taping! Eric loves it when he screams at her! Steven, I never even slept with Michael.<br/> Yeah right, because Kelso is always showing up at my hotelroom naked with a bucket of ice.<br/> You know, this is your fault too.<br/> Okay you two, just stop yelling! Go ahead.<br/> No, forget it.<br/> Well, I guess that\\'s that.<br/> Well, that was horrible.<br/> Yeah, I know.<br/> Where the hell is my little tiny slotmachine? Red, can you please just do me a favour and tell Eric you miss him a little? Oh, fine! Give me the thing.<br/> Eric, this is a little hard for me \\'cause I\\'m not real emotional, but I wanted to tell you that your GI Joe\\'s were killed.<br/> In the great Dumpster-war of 1979.<br/> Well, your meatloaf was lost in the great \"Make-your-own-dinner-war\" of 19-TODAY! Well, Eric now that I have a second, I should catch you up on your new friend, Charlie.<br/> Okay.<br/> Who brought the beer? I thought you were bringing the beer.<br/> No.<br/> You were bringing beer, I was chips.<br/> You\\'re beer, I was chips.<br/> Fine.<br/> Give me the chips.<br/> I forgot the chips.<br/> You know, I forgot to stay home.<br/> You guys How much do we love this guy? He\\'s a prince! Charlie, it is so awesome hanging out with you.<br/> Ah, thanks guys, it feels so good to finally belong to something, you know.<br/> It\\'s like the first day of the rest of my life! The beer! That was a pretty awkward landing.<br/> I hope he\\'s okay.<br/> Yeah, of course he\\'s okay.<br/> It\\'s not like anyone ever died falling off the watertower.<br/> And so they renamed it the Charlie Richardson Memorial Watertower.<br/> Jackie, Hyde just needed to blow off some steam, you guys aren\\'t over.<br/> Well, if you won\\'t talk to me then maybe you\\'ll talk to Mr.<br/> Fluffycakes.<br/> Jackie! My magical horn senses that you\\'re sad and you need someone to talk to! Great! Now he can\\'t hear you.<br/> Hey.<br/> Jackie.<br/> Oh, what do you want? Man, I feel really bad about the way things turned out.<br/> You and Hyde should be together, okay.<br/> Go talk to him.<br/> Look, there is no point, okay.<br/> I\\'m starting to think Steven never really wanted to be with me at all.<br/> This must be how ugly people feel all the time.<br/> I wouldn\\'t know about the ugly thing.<br/> But I do know that he does wanna be with you.<br/> Why else would he drive all the way to Chicago to propose to you? Wait! what? Oh, my God! Steven was gonna propose?! I have to find him! Tell you what, that\\'s the last time I wanna mess around with a girl with a boyfriend.<br/> Kelso, your hand is on my butt.<br/> Come on! he\\'s in Africa.<br/> You know Red, it really upset me this afternoon when you wouldn\\'t say anything nice to Eric.<br/> Well I can see how that would surprise you, what with nice things always bubbling out of my mouth.<br/> Well, it would just mean a lot to me to hear you say how you feel.<br/> Don\\'t you even miss him? Well, let\\'s say I did.<br/> I still wouldn\\'t feel comfortable saying it on tape.<br/> Well would it kill you just to say it to me here in private? Oh, fine! I miss him! Of course I miss him.<br/> He\\'s my son Why do you always make me say things?! Yeah.<br/> I should be in the FBI.<br/> So anyway Forman, ramble on, keep on keeping on.<br/> Most of all my friend rock on.<br/> You know, I never used to understand that hippie-jargon, but ever since my \"bathroom-experiment\".<br/> I\\'m cool man! Oh.<br/> okay.<br/> Let me just give you two some privacy.<br/> Hey.<br/> Hey.<br/> Steven, I am so sorry about what happened in Chicago.<br/> I was alone and I thought I lost you.<br/> Yeah well, I can see why you thought that.<br/> Look, why didn\\'t you tell me sooner you wanted to get married? Because I wasn\\'t sure I wanted to.<br/> And now that I\\'ve thought about it.<br/> I\\'m right.<br/> I\\'m not ready to be married yet.<br/> Yet? Oh, okay.<br/> Well, there you have it.<br/> Eric Steven\\'s not ready to get married yet.<br/> Hi, I\\'m looking for Hyde! Hey baby! Hey Sam.<br/> Who the hell is that? This is Sam.<br/> She\\'s a st exotic dancer I met in Vegas.<br/> Oh, I\\'m sorry, what-what are you doing here? You don\\'t remember? We got married.<br/> Oh, my God! What? One more thing, Eric.<br/> Steven married a stripper! Being up here makes me think of my poor friend Billy.<br/> His name was Charlie, you cantaloup.<br/> Kelso, you\\'ve fallen off this thing like ten times.<br/> It\\'s so scary to think you could have you know, like met the same fate as Charlie.<br/> Yeah.<br/> So we go through our lives like thinking we\\'re invincible right, but the truth is we\\'re totally \\'vincible.<br/> Screw that! I\\'m invincible!   <br/>\\n</div>'}"
